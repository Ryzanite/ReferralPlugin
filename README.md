# ReferralPlugin


I've made it public for the sake of my application for HiddenDevs

I'll brief you what this does:

It's a plugin that allows you to create a type of referall system inside Minecraft.

When a player joins they can do the command "/referral {player}" which will give them award.
They can only refer 1 player and 1 player only. This is a good plugin as it can boost playercounts

fyi: If you would like to try it yourself you would have to go inside Referral.class and change the DB details as this plugin was not made to be public.
